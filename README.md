# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview
Since identifying credit risks is naturally an unbalanced classification problem, imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries are used to build and evaluate the machine learning models. To get around the severely skewed class distribution, an oversampling and undersampling techniques are used with RandomOverSampler, SMOTE, and SMOTEENN algorithms. Following the sampling, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier machine learning models are compared in order to reduce any forms of bias. These models are also used to predict the credit risk.
